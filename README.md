# Fire-Detection-System-Using-YOLOv9-Approach
This project proposes an innovative intelligent fire detection software that leverages deep learning to accurately identify fire and smoke in real-time from video and image data sources. The software utilizes the YOLOv9 algorithm to analyze visual data and integrates additional data sources, to enhance accuracy and reduce false alarms. It features an automated notification system, providing timely alerts to authorities and offers real-time video feeds and data to emergency responders. The software offers improved accuracy, faster response times, and enhanced situational awareness, reducing the impact of fire accidents and improving fire safety.
